# @waptik/graphql-pusher-subscriptions. A fork of [alefemafra/graphql-pusher-subscriptions](https://github.com/alefemafra/graphql-pusher-subscriptions)

This package implements the PubSubEngine Interface from the graphql-subscriptions package and also the new AsyncIterator interface. It allows you to connect your subscriptions manger to a Pusher channel and bind to multiple events.

## Usage

After creating an account and configuring a channel on pusher, you get the necessary config information about your application. Keep the config information in a safe place.

```javascript
import { PusherChannel } from "@waptik/graphql-pusher-subscriptions";

const pubsub = new PusherChannel({
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  key: "APP_KEY",
  secret: "SECRET",
  cluster: "YOUR_SELECTED_CLUSTER",
  channel: "CHANNEL_NAME",
});
```
